# Automata theory project 

This project was developed as part of our Avans Breda TI curriculum.

This project is multi-platform (using Mono), but optimised for use under OS X and Linux.

To use all of this program's functionalities you should install the folowing programs:

If you're using Windows:
  * Graphviz

If you're using Linux:
  * Graphviz
  * xdg-open (included in all major distro's)
  * pdflatex (install "texlive" or "texlive-full" using your favourite package manager)
  * babel package Dutch (install "texlive-lang-dutch" using your favourite package manager)

If you're using OS X:
  * Graphviz
  * pdflatex (install MacTeX as found on this website http://www.tug.org/mactex/)

(Why an English readme when the application is Dutch? Because DuckDuckGo/Bing/Yandex don't speak Dutch, that's why)
